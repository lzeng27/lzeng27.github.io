# Problem and motivation

The design problem I want to address is providing a better learning experience for museum visitors. This is an important problem because art is often seen as a selective space and is accessible only to those who have a background in art. In this way, museums may only attract a self-selecting population. From my personal experience, as someone who doesn’t have a background in art history, my opinions about art pieces are my immediate reactions e.g. it looks nice. In my own experience, I wanted to learn more about art, but didn’t know how. 

# Analysis of problem

The current solution many museums employ is guided museum tours. In addition, museums often have a block of text outside the exhibit providing context and explanations for the exhibit. For other pieces, there is often a small block of text next to the artwork. Though this is a means of providing information about the museums, there can be situations where there a lot of text and visitors don’t have the attention span to spend significant amounts of time reading.
